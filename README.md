# Roblox-External
Working roblox external bypassing every anticheat, also works on web version of roblox - 64bit recommended.

HOW TO USE IT?

YOU HAVE TO DOWNLOAD NANOEXTERNAL.EXE.

AFTER YOU DOWNLOAD, OPEN IT UP BUT BEFORE OPENING YOU HAVE TO BE IN ROBLOX.

AFTER YOU OPEN IT UP THE MENU SHOULD POP UP WITH SILENT AIM AND ESP OPTIONS.

GOOD LUCK!
